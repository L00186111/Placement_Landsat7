### Introduction
Coastal and oceanic environments have biophysical characteristics that marine researchers can now monitor and analyze using information from the satellites. For example, the Landsat-7 satellite has extensive Earth observation datasets which are crucial for thorough investigations of marine ecosystems, coastal morphology, sediment transport, and water quality monitoring. Unfortunately, these datasets are not easily accessible, and processing them often requires specialized programming workflows that software developers could easily navigate, although they pose a substantive barrier to most scientists.

This document outlines a specialized simplified DevOps pipeline tailored to marine researchers and based on Landsat-7 data. The focus is to create a reproducible and intuitive workflow that automates various aspects of increasing the quality and versioning of Python programs used for data preparation and evaluation, enhancing the ease of maintenance. Incorporating advanced automation techniques as well as optimized coding standards helps to simplify the pipeline while providing answers for the focusing questions posed by researchers which are often stifled by overwhelming technical hurdles.

The researchers using this workflow can assume control over the management of their code, improving collaboration and analysis reliability within a framework of perpetual advancement and assurance of static data.
